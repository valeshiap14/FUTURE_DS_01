# FUTURE_DS_01
Business Sales Performance Analytics – Task 1 (2026)  By Future Interns

## About This Project

This project is all about understanding business sales in a practical, real-world way. The goal was to answer questions like:

* Which products bring in the most money?
* How do sales change over time?
* Which categories or regions are most profitable?
* Where should the business focus to grow faster?

Instead of just making charts, I focused on creating actionable insights—like a mini business consultant helping a real company.

## Tools I Used

* Power BI – for building the interactive dashboard
* Jupyter Notebook (Python) – for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
* Excel / CSV – raw data handling
* Python Libraries: pandas, matplotlib

## How the Project Is Organized

Folder structure:

* Superstore sales dataset (`superstore_sales.csv`)
* Step-by-step analysis in `business_sales_analysis.ipynb`
*  Power BI dashboard file `superstore_sales_dashboard.pbix`
* **images/** – Exported visuals or charts
* **README.md** – Project documentation

## What I Did

1. **Cleaned the Data**

   * Checked for missing or duplicate entries
   * Made sure everything was formatted correctly

2. **Analyzed Sales & Profit**

   * Found top-selling products and categories
   * Tracked revenue and profit trends over time

3. **Looked at Categories & Regions**

   * Compared how different product categories perform
   * Saw which regions are doing well and which need attention

4. **Drew Insights & Made Recommendations**
   

**Key Takeaways:**

* A small number of products generate most of the revenue
* Sales grow over time, but profits don’t always match
* Some categories sell well but aren’t very profitable
* Regional performance varies significantly

**Recommendations:**

* Focus marketing and inventory on high-profit products
* Review discount strategies for low-profit categories
* Investigate underperforming regions to reduce losses
* Prioritize improving strong products before expanding blindly
  

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard (`superstore_sales_dashboard.pbix`) lets you:

* Explore revenue and profit trends interactively
* See product and category performance visually
* Compare sales across regions
* Understand insights at a glance

You can open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to explore it yourself.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Jupyter Notebook**

   * Open `_business_sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code
   * Make sure the Python libraries pandas, matplotlib are installed

2. **Power BI Dashboard**

   * Open `superstore_sales_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop

3. **Dataset**

   * Find the CSV in the zip folder

## Dataset

I used the Superstore Sales Dataset from Kaggle:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

You can also use your own business sales data—just make sure it has columns for products, categories, sales, profit, and regions.

## What I Learned

* How to clean and prepare messy data
* How to analyze KPIs and trends for real business decisions
* How to build dashboards that communicate insights clearly
* How to turn raw numbers into actionable business advice


## Next Steps

* Apply these skills to real businesses or personal projects
* Explore additional analytics like customer segmentation or seasonal trends
* Share dashboards with business owners or online to build a portfolio
